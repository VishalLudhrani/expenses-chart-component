## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- How to import JSON content in JavaScript without using frameworks
- Revised a few media query topics (`screen` and `width`)
- Practiced CSS selector specificity

### Continued development

Things I will focus on more often hereafter:
- Practising `grid` and `flexbox` layouts
- Writing DRY code more often
